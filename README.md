# TypeScript Express Server

### Getting Started

`yarn install`

`yarn server`

### Note

Please be aware: This is an API-only codebase. There are no views. I recommend using Postman to work with your API and then introduce the API to a client, like React or Angular.

### Todo

I'll be adding new features when I find the time. Expect the next feature to be Auth w/ Passport and after that, maybe Sendgrid.

### Using

- MongoDB
- Node/Express
- TypeScript (w/ ES6)
