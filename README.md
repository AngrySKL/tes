# TypeScript Express Server

### Getting Started

`yarn install`

`yarn server:dev`

### About:
I have two repos effectively doing the same thing. This repo uses TypeScript to it's fullest while the other repo (<a href="https://github.com/iamclaytonray/node-blog-api">here</a>) is meant to ,more-or-less, show an Express server written in ES6 style, without Webpack. I'll introduce Webpack in the other repo.

I was pretty motivated to write this server with TypeScript because I see a lot of very poorly done Node/Express servers. Besides, TypeScript is just amazing. This server is not perfect but I will reference this often for boilerplating my own projects/servers. That means that I will continue to fix bugs, update dependencies and make sure that this codebase is maintained, while shooting for this to be really well done. Questions? Shoot me an email or connect via social media.

### Using:

- MongoDB
- Node/Express
- TypeScript
- Webpack
