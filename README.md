# TypeScript Express Server

### Getting Started

`yarn install`

`yarn server`

### Note

Please be aware: This is an API-only codebase. There are no views. I recommend using Postman to work with your API and then introduce the API to a client, like React or Angular.

### Using

- MongoDB
- Node/Express
- TypeScript
- Webpack
